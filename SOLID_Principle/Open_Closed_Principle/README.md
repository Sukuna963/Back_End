* The Open-Closed Principle states that objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
This means they should be extendable without altering their core implementation. 
This principle can be applied in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by creating new classes that extend the original class and override its methods, 
rather than modifying the original class directly. (ERAMI Reza, 2023)
