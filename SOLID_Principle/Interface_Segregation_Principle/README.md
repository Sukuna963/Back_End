* The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) suggests that a class should not be forced to implement methods it doesnâ€™t need. 
In other words, a class should have small, focused interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones. 
This helps to avoid unnecessary dependencies and ensures that classes only implement the methods they actually need. (RAMDHAS, 2023)
