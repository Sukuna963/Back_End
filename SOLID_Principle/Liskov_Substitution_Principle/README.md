* The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that any subclass of a superclass should be usable in place of 
its superclass without introducing errors or altering the expected behavior of the program. 
In simpler terms, if code is written to work with a specific type of object (the base class), 
it should also be able to work seamlessly with any of its subclasses (derived classes) without any issues or surprises. (KARROPOULOS Theodore, 2023)
